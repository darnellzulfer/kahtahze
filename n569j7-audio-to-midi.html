When you come right down to it, an audio interface is anything that lets you get audio signals in and out of your computer. The challenge in picking one is that there are so many ways of getting it done, and it will all depend on how you like to work and what you're trying I think it's possible but don't know how to do this. I've been trying out the audio to midi plugin under JS. My question is can you use your mic to trigger ezdrummer 2 live when playing instead of recording it and sending to ezdrummer later. I want to record the drums live straight through the audio to midi with plugins. In usually record the drums with individual mics. I split the transits using dynamic split and send to ezdrummer. I just trying to find a better way to record the drums Sound. I'm a trombonist looking to use my instrument as a MIDI controller in a live setting and I'm hoping to be pointed in the right direction as it's still somewhat of a new topic for me. My question is this - Is there a way to convert audio to MIDI while retaining all the original inflections (pitch bends/intonation, Dynamics, etc.) of my performance? I know that products exist which convert audio signal to MIDI, but all melodic MIDI data that I've recorded has been with a MIDI keyboard Audio Engineers.

I'm hopong to take a clean signal from an acoustic stomp board and at some point in the chain turn that into something that will give me an ableton link bpm or a midi signal i can map to a tap tempo trigger for lighting. acoustic stomps use a peizo pickup, and so do midi drums, so i figure to take a long and convoluted way around, i could in theory split my acoustic stomp into two cables and run one into my electric 
Hello guys, I'd like to know anyone of you who have done this and how you've been always doing it. Do you use a software to estimate the notes and export to MIDI? or Do you manually transcribe the song in notation sofrware and export How do I correctly convert an audio sample to midi? I have some single note samples I would like to be able to put on a piano roll so that I can make a melody out of this. Another problem I'm having is whenever I try to convert an audio sample to midi it ALWAYS changes the note to a simple basic piano. It could be a large blasting horn but when I convert to midi it's a piano (and the same piano with every sample). Any advice. My friend did some piano, and I need to convert it to MIDI to plug it into a VST for LMMS. I have zero budget but there's gotta be some free way to do it right? All the sites to do so seem sketchy. I am brand spankin' new to Max. I know this is possible, one of my favorite musicians uses Max this way to have Vocaloid sing what he plays on his saxophone. I may message him and see if he'd be willing to share the file, but I'd still like to get familiar with Max myself, so much potential with it. Any specific resources I should check out? Or just work with the tutorials. Trying to convert a kick audio track to MIDI so I can use it with different kits. The kick is the only thing on the track and the transients are very obvious. When converting the audio to MIDI, logic randomly misses notes, and the manual addition is kinda tedious in the flex editor. I feel like I'm missing a slider or something that ups the threshold of logic's finding of the notes. Here's what it looks like when i hit convert: Flex Editor Screen Shot (https://imgur.com/a/bxzt4Y1) 
I want to take a piezo pickup, tape it under my desk and convert my desk into a midi trigger to bang out some rhythms. I was looking at some vst's and max4live plugins but wanted to ask if anyone has tried this and if they have a favorite or if it didn't Does anyone know if there‚Äôs a way to tweak the settings for the audio to midi conversion option they have? (Convert harmony/melody/drums to new midi track). Hey again. I sliced a vocal to make a word as a MIDI. In FL Studio i clicked "Make unique" and blablabla. What should I do in ableton to use a sliced audio as MIDI? Thanks. Ohhhh my gooood I recommend this video. literally just learned some simple shit that I didn‚Äôt even think about it till now. Also I fuck with his channel, he‚Äôs got good vids üí™üèºüëçüèª https://youtu.be/kIXXv8oUqOc. Is this feature only available in the new version of ableton. 
I was wondering if there are any plugins (for Mac especially because I run Mac but honestly for any OS) that convert audio to MIDI while maintaining the exact pitch of the notes. This would be my dream plugin but I'm not sure if any exist. If there aren't any such plugins, is there another MultitrackStudio is audio/MIDI multitrack recording software for both home recording, one track at a time, and live multitrack recording.
